   This repository is supplementary  to our confernce paper: TBD.
   
   ## Examples of songs with diffrent parameters:
   [Songs per tree: 50 Steps: 1 Average sequance length: 2.6](Songs/Songs_per_tree_50_steps_1_Ls_2.6.mp3)
   [Songs per tree: 1200 Steps: 1 Average sequance length: 3.6](Songs/Songs_per_tree_1200_steps_1_Ls_3.6.mp3)
   [Songs per tree: 1200 Steps: 5 Average sequance length: 6.64](Songs/Songs_per_tree_1200_stpes_5_Ls_6.64.mp3)
   [Songs per tree: 1200 Steps: 15 Average sequance length: 16.5](Songs/Song_per_tree_1200_steps_15_Ls_16.5.mp3)
   [Songs per tree: 25 Steps: 15 Average sequance length: 14.3](Songs/Song_per_tree_25_steps_15_Ls_14.3.mp3)
  
## How to run the code
- To run the code you need to download the MAESTRO database to the code's folder: https://magenta.withgoogle.com/datasets/maestro, specificly the midi version ("maestro-v3.0.0-midi.zip").
    
- Run the pre-processing code in the file: "maestro_to_vector.py"
    
- You can now run LZ_MIDI_data.py to hear diffrent songs.
